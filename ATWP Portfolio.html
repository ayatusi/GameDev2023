    <div class="portfolio-title">ATWP135 Portfolio</div>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>When I began ATWP135 I didn’t think of myself as a strong or confident writer. In my first assignment, the Personal Literacy Statement, I wrote that writing felt like a sprint, and that I’d often struggle to choose a side in argumentative writing. I described how writing drained my energy and made me feel uncreative. Now, as I look back at the work in this portfolio, I see a clear positive shift in how I understand and approach writing. This portfolio won’t show a perfect writer or a huge transformation, what it will show is how I've grown from writing with uncertainty into someone who can organize ideas, back up claims with sources and navigate the writing process confidently. The four assignments I’ve included reflect that growth.</p>

      <p>The first assignment, my Personal Literacy Statement from January 13, was written when I was still figuring out how I felt about my writing in general. In high school, writing always felt like just meeting a deadline, it was never something I ever enjoyed. I often struggled to even start because I expected too much from the first draft. In the assignment I reflected on Anne Lamott’s “Shitty First Drafts” and how freeing it was to realize that the first version doesn’t need to be perfect. That idea stuck with me and helped take off a lot of pressure I used to put on myself, a very good first assignment for my first university writing class.</p>

      <p>Next came the Academic Summary on January 27, where I had to focus on clearly and accurately summarizing someone else’s ideas without inserting my own opinion. It was harder than it looked. I had to slow down and figure out what the article was saying, re-reading certain points over again, and then I had to explain it in a straightforward, concise way. The assignment really helped me get more comfortable with writing objectively and structuring paragraphs clearly. It was also the first time I used APA citation and I realized how much formatting matters in academic writing.</p>

      <p>The Persuading Skeptics assignment on February 16 is where I really started to feel a shift. I used the same article from the Academic Summary, but this time I had to engage with it critically, take a position on where I stand in the argument and respond to counter arguments. It pushed me to write more persuasively and helped me understand how to bring in research as real support for what I’m trying to say. I also started working more on my voice and tone. This assignment showed me that I could take a clear position and effectively defend it with evidence and structure.</p>

      <p>Finally, The Peer Review and Draft Intro from March 17 shows the biggest step forward for me. By then, I was more comfortable with academic sources, how to cite and use them effectively, and narrowing my focus to something specific and researchable. The topic I chose was media portrayals of lesbianism and the male gaze, it stood out to me because I’m a part of the LGBTQ+ community and constantly noticed these kinds of portrayals in the media. I used scholarly articles and films to support my claims. The outline helped me organize my thoughts clearly from the start which made the whole writing process smoother. Compared to the first month of the course, this draft felt more like a real academic writer’s work and not just a student trying to fill a word count.</p>

      <p>Across these four assignments, the biggest changes are in my confidence, structure, approach, and use of research. I don't feel as overwhelmed by writing anymore because of the strategies I learned from ATWP135, including outlining before I start, using my sources with purpose, and not stressing out about the first draft so much and just diving in to get my ideas on paper. My writing still isn’t perfect and I know I still have so many areas to improve, but this portfolio shows that I’ve moved forward and made progress, enough to be proud of.</p>
